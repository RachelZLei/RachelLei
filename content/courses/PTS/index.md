## Overview

This page collects my materials for the **PTS courses** (PTS1–PTS3).  
Focus: probability, mathematical statistics, estimation, hypothesis testing, asymptotics.

- Instructor notes: **my own summaries**, not official lecture notes  
- I **do not** upload course lecture slides.  
- Some **readers/textbooks** are linked for reference.
